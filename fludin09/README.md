# fludin09

A new Flutter project.

## DropdownButton

- What type of data dropdown returns?
- At item prop, you have to use DropdownMenuItem, that has a child.
- `onChanged`: always when you update a value, use setState().


## Import

- use `import 'dart:io' show Platform;` to import only a specific method. Maybe you use `hide` or `as`.
