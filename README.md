# Why Flutter?

- Maily because you have only a single code base?
- Because you have to handle with many screen sizes? And constraints, essentially, get more complex as the number of elements grow on screen. So constraints can be really easy to do and do well if you only have four or five things on screen but we're no longer in 3.5 inch screen era anymore. Inspiration from web? Maybe... and there's a lot of core concepts from web design that comes into Flutter development.
- Create your app like a native way?
- You need to learn a new programming language?
- What is DART?
- Hot reload? Cool!
- Open source? Cool!

> Flutter: it's simply a toolkit that makes it easy for developers to design beautiful interfaces for all sorts of screen sizes and devices, and it comes with a whole bunch of prebuilt widgets that make it easy to layout your app with a simple and flexible layout system.

> When you're building Flutter apps, it's kind of like working with Lego Technic.
